# Camera research
I initially asked ChatGPT if it could provide me with a top 5 list of the best camera options we can use for the project. I also mentioned that we intend to use OpenCV and a raspberry pi 4.
It provide me with this list:
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- Arducam
- Logitech C270
- Sony IMX219 Camera Module
- HQ Camera Module

In this list It also gave me some pro’s and con’s for the different types of cameras. After checking everything out I went and searched some cameras on my own. I found this website: https://www.slashgear.com/1275431/best-raspberry-pi-cameras-2023/ 
This article gave me a lot of inside about 4 different cameras:
- Raspberry pi camera module
- Arducam
- HQ camera
- Shutter camera
Each of these has their unique traits for example the shutter camera is very good for capturing high speed objects that move past it, but that is something we don’t really need and the price is almost sixty euros which is way too expensive for the project.

Than we have the HQ camera which also is not an option for our budget, also for our project we don’t need 12.3 megapixels to recognise the different objects. A nice feature for this camera is that you can add different lenses which would be nice if you want a wider area for the camera to see.

Moving on to the Arducam and the raspberry pi camera, both of these are possible for the project with the same price range and similar specs. I think the deciding factor will be that if it is possible that school can provide one of these cameras we will be taking it. It will save time and money. But preferably we want to use the raspberry pi camera because we used it in the past, it is affordable and was made for the raspberry pi.

After talking with the school they could only provide me with the camera module rb-camera-jt-v2-77 this camera would also work fine for this project because it is compatible with the raspberry pi so we decided to use this one for the project.
